Drive3D is an open-source web application that enables users to use WebGl to
view OBJ/MTL files that are stored on Google Drive. The source code of Drive3D
can be found at https://github.com/bergwerf/drive3d. This version of the source
code is published at http://drive.hermanbergwerf.com via GitHub pages.

Drive3D uses OAuth in order to authenticate with Google Drive. This access is
used by the app to:

- Read OBJ and MTL files from your Google Drive for visualization
- List all OBJ files in your Google Drive account when you visit the application
- Search for an MTL file with the same name when you load an OBJ file in order
  to attach material settings

Welcome to my blog! You can find some old posts here. I want to write more but
coding is keeping me busy ;-).

## About me
I recently finished a bachelor in nanobiology at TU Delft, and my interests have
shifted towards logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science and I moved
to Nijmegen to attend the MFOCS MSc program. You can contact me by sending an
email to post at hbergwerf dot nl.

Welcome to my blog! You can find some old posts here. I want to write more but
coding is keeping me busy ;-).

## About me
I recently finished a bachelor in nanobiology at TU Delft, but my interests have
shifted towards logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science and I moved
to Nijmegen to attend the MFOCS MSc program. If you want to say hi or ask me a 
question, feel free to email me at hermanbergwerf@gmail.com.

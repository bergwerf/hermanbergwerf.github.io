Welcome to my blog! You can find some old posts here. I want to write more but
coding is keeping me busy ;-). You can reach me via
`hermanbergwerf [at] gmail.com`.

## About me
I am currently doing a BSc nanobiology (bionanoscience) at TU Delft. I am super
passionate about coding and user interface design. My projects range from 3D
graphics using WebGL/GLSL, to witing a rewrite system to formalize mathematical
proofs, to building a bridge between the FLTK widget library and the Dart VM. I
have been using Dart as my main langauge for a while. A more complete overview
of all my (open-source) projects can be found at my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/bergwerf).

Welcome to my blog! You can find some old posts here. I want to write more but
coding is keeping me busy ;-). You can reach me via hermanbergwerf@gmail.com.

## About me
I recently finished a bachelor in nanobiology at TU Delft, but my interests have
shifted towards logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science.

There is nothing that gives me as much focus and satisfaction as working on my
own side projects. I am currently an happy user of the Dart programming
language.

Welcome! There is nothing here (yet) but you can find some public code on my 
GitHub account @bergwerf. Lately my programming work is mostly focussed on 
formal verification of mathematics. Feel free to contact me via post at 
hbergwerf dot nl. I currently live in Nijmegen where I study mathematics and 
computer science.
